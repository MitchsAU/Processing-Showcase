        <h2>Exercise Notes</h2>
        <p>Clicking and holding Mouse 1 will let you drag the sqaure across the screen, when the ball or donut hits the square +1 will be added to your score in the top left hand corner. But beware! The 4 sliders on the top, bottom, left and right set the count back to 0 if the small circle hits them! The donut is not affected by them. You can move these sliders using the arrows keys to avoid this. See how many points you can collect!</p>
